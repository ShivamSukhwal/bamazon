# bamazon

a database called bamazon that displays products through mySQL database.

When you load the app through the command prompt you will see a table that displays an Id, the name of the product, as well as the price in dollars.

From there a prompt pops up and asks you to type in the id number of the product you wish to purchase.

A second prompt will follow up right afterwords asking you how many of those items you wish to purchase.

If the current inventory meets your demand then congradulations you have just made a successful purchase at the Bamazon store, if not you will receive a message stating we do not have enough items in stock and you will be returned to the product id prompt.

Happy Shopping!!!
